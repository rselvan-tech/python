Challenges - Functions
How to solve these coding challenges:

Write your solution in PyCharm or in your preferred Python IDE.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, watch the video again, rewrite the solution, and test it again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Save the solution in a file for future reference or recap.

Challenge #1

Write a Python function that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list in the same order.

Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5, 1, 3, 5, 5, 5]

Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Challenge #8

Change the solution of the previous challenge so that the function receives a string of numbers separated by a comma.

Example:

nums = '2, 3, 10, 5'

print(equilibrium_index(nums)) # => 2

nums = '3, 3, 10, 5'

print(equilibrium_index(nums)) # => False
