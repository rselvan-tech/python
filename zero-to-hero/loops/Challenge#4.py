An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.

Input: Enter the lengths of the triangle sides:
x: 6
y: 8
z: 12

Expected Output: Scalene triangle.
'''
x=int(input('Enter Triangle side-1 : '))
y=int(input('Enter Triangle side-1 : '))
z=int(input('Enter Triangle side-1 : '))
