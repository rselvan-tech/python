Challenge #4

Write a Python script that checks if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

The user will be prompted for the triangle sides.

Note:

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length.

An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides.

A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.



Input: Enter the lengths of the triangle sides:

x: 6

y: 8

z: 12

Expected Output: Scalene triangle.
